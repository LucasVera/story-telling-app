# Story-Telling App POC

This is a simple proof of concept app for an ai-powered application that generates short stories based on user input. The app uses aws technologies to accomplish this:

- React + Typescript for the front-end
- AWS Amplify + UI Components
- AWS Amplify AI Kit
- AWS AppSync
- Amazon Bedrock
- Claude Sonnet 3.5

Using these technologies, in just a matter of 2 hours I could go from idea to working app! The blog post that describes the process and architecture can be found [HERE](https://www.serverlessguru.com/blog/short-story-generator-with-aws-bedrock-and-amplify).
